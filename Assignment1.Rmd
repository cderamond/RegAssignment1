# Executive summary

# Introduction

In this report we'll study the relationship between MPG and several features of vehicles. By the end of this study we hope to have answered these two questions:

1. *“Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG”*

2. *"Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions"*

All the data used in this report comes from `mtcars` dataset available on R datasets package.

# Analysis

## Exploratory

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='hide', cache=TRUE}
library(datasets)
library(ggplot2)
library(GGally)
tol_cor <- .55

yvx <- cor(mtcars)[1,]
selSet <- names(yvx[ which(abs(yvx) > tol_cor)]) # we will include only the ones with |cor| > .55
data<- mtcars[,selSet]

##grafico de pares
pairsXY <- ggpairs(
                data,
                title = "Y vs X, scatter matrix",
                upper = list(continuous = "cor"),
                lower = list(continuous = "smooth", 
                             params = c(method = "lm", fill = "red"))
)
##grafico de corr
corXY <- ggcorr(data) #+ ggtitle("Correlation matrix")
##

```

We'll start the process by discarding all variables which have a lower than `r tol_cor` correlation with our output `mpg`. This process lefts us with `r length(selSet) - 1` variables. 

A quick [scatter matrix](#g01) shows many interesting relationships that we should address:

        - `cil, vs, am` are discrete variable variables. Of this 3 vs will be taken out inmediately, as it has low explanatory interest.
        
        - 
        
```{r}
data <- data[,-7] #remove vs

```


Time to look for multicolinearity:

If you see [Graph 02](#g02), the risk for muticolinearity (i.e. our predictor are not independent among each other) is high.
