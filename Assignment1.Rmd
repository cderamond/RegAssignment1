# Introduction

In this report we'll study the relationship between MPG and several features of vehicles. By the end of this study we hope to have answered these two questions:
1. **“Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG”**
2. **"Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions"**

All the data used in this report comes from `mtcars` dataset available on R datasets package.
