# RegAssignment1

Assignment 1 from reg. models course @coursera

##Context

You work for Motor Trend, a magazine about the automobile industry. Looking at a data set of a collection of cars, they are interested in exploring the relationship between a set of variables and miles per gallon (MPG) (outcome). They are particularly interested in the following two questions:

 - “Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG”
 - "Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions"

##Question

Take the `mtcars` data set and write up an analysis to answer their question using regression models and exploratory data analyses.

## Files 

- Assignment1.Rmd : the Rmarkdown document from which the final PDF file is generated.

- proj1_sparseCode.R : spare code, not really part of the assignment, merely utilitarian.
